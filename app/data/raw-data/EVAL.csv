71,2022,20-02,Internal Medicine,2020-2021,State Park,1,1,2,68,3,2,4,2,5,I was glad to be on service with someone else so I wasn't completely alone. The case presentations were helpful for my learning.,148379,"I was told before the rotation that being on the same service the whole time wouldn't be a good educational experience but I wasn't able to switch services. I was also told that the teaching was excellent, but I received close to zero teaching. On the first day of the rotation, I was told three pieces of advice by a staff member. 1) Don't ever speak to the attending without being spoken to. 2) If you have to cough in the OR, don't. and 3) the only reason I may leave the OR is if I have my period and am bleeding through my scrubs. I was scared to ask questions for the first two weeks. I wasn't included as a part of the team and had no direction in the afternoon. Neither the residents nor the attendings took any time to teach and sometimes would not even acknowledge us as students. We were not allowed to catheterize or participate in any procedures even though we advocated for the chance to do so (my fellow student catheterized one time because they were in a surgery with a different attending/fellow). We were given huge presentations last minute (which was not the case for students on other services) and between that and the long hours (and weekend hours), had absolutely no time to study for the shelf exam or learn about basic bread and butter surgery topics. We never once got feedback on notes despite writing them every day. We had no idea how to help and would be chided for helping the wrong way if we tried (without any constructive criticism) , and chided for not doing anything. We were made to feel stupid constantly, including when we asked questions. This was a really toxic rotation and I'm disappointed because I went in so excited to learn and tried my hardest the whole time despite being ignored and torn down at every opportunity. I don't think students feel comfortable giving negative feedback especially on a service with an attending that's so influential, but as an example, a previous student reported being physically ill from stress during this entire rotation. I have no idea how to change or dress a wound or catheterize or do basic things that will help me in my future career. It would help if the expectations were very clear and these expectations were communicated to the chief. It would help if feedback could be given without being required to call out residents or attendings by name, because that prevents any feedback from being given (for fear of retribution). It would be helpful to make it more seamless and acceptable to switch services. It would be helpful if students could have individual check-ins with Dr. Tholey or someone during the rotation to give feedback and get help. It would be helpful if people were made to feel more comfortable giving feedback.",7,4

The residents at Einstein are some of the most toxic people I have ever met. I have never felt so useless and inadequate in my entire life. All the students were ignored on a daily basis, not involved in patient care, and simply brushed aside. The residents do not care about each other, the patients, and certainly not the students. The attendings also did not care about us at all. I would highly discourage anyone from rotating at Einstein for surgery. I rotated here for IM and had a wonderful experience.",7,1
